# string-concat

### 1. clone the project and extract into your go path

### 2. replace ```plainText``` value with string value you'd expect to be concatenated.
   
-   example:
    - ```plainText := SISKAEEE``` string data input

    - run ```go run main.go``` to execute the script
        
    - code will map the value inside to count each character and concat the total_character + character
        
    - ```2S1I1K1A3E``` is the sample output (ps: output value can be random)
